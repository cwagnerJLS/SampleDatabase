# Logging Refactoring - Phase 6

## Date: August 25, 2025

### Overview
Consolidated and refactored all logging throughout the application to use a centralized configuration with all logs stored in the `logs/` directory.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Created Centralized Logging Configuration
- **File**: `samples/logging_config.py`
- Defines all log file locations in a single `LOG_FILES` dictionary
- Provides `get_logger()` function for consistent logger initialization
- Includes Django logging configuration (`DJANGO_LOGGING_CONFIG`)
- Standardized log format across all modules

#### 2. Log File Consolidation
All log files now reside in `/home/jls/Desktop/SampleDatabase/logs/`:
- `django.log` - Django application logs
- `django_error.log` - Django error logs
- `celery.log` - Celery worker logs
- `celery_worker.log` - Additional Celery worker logs
- `backup.log` - Database backup operation logs
- `health_monitor.log` - Health monitoring system logs
- `sharepoint.log` - SharePoint integration logs
- `email.log` - Email service logs
- `debug.log` - General debug logs
- `rclone_sync.log` - Rclone sync operation logs
- `cron.log` - Cron job execution logs

#### 3. Updated Modules
- **Django Settings** (`inventory_system/settings.py`): Now imports and uses `DJANGO_LOGGING_CONFIG`
- **Email Utils** (`samples/email_utils.py`): Uses centralized logger for email operations
- **SharePoint Modules**:
  - `samples/CreateOppFolderSharepoint.py`: Uses sharepoint logger
  - `samples/EditExcelSharepoint.py`: Uses sharepoint logger
- **Backup Script** (`backup_database.py`): Uses centralized backup logger
- **Health Monitor** (`monitor_health.py`): Uses centralized health_monitor logger

#### 4. System Service Updates
- **django-sampledb.service**: Updated log paths to `logs/` directory
- **celery-sampledb.service**: Updated log paths to `logs/` directory

#### 5. Cron Job Updates
Updated crontab entries:
- Removed direct log redirection for `backup_database.py` (now handled internally)
- Updated SharePoint population job to log to `logs/cron.log`
- Removed direct log redirection for `monitor_health.py` (now handled internally)

#### 6. Documentation Updates
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new log file locations
- Added information about centralized logging structure

### Benefits
1. **Centralized Management**: All log configuration in one place
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized log format across all modules
3. **Organized Structure**: All logs in dedicated `logs/` directory
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single point of configuration for all logging
5. **Better Separation**: Different log files for different concerns (email, SharePoint, etc.)
6. **Simplified Monitoring**: All logs in one location for easier access

### Migration Notes
- Existing log files have been moved to the `logs/` directory
- Services need to be reloaded for new log paths to take effect:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart django-sampledb
  sudo systemctl restart celery-sampledb
  ```

### Testing
Created and ran `test_logging.py` to verify:
- All log files are created correctly
- Loggers write to appropriate files
- Log format is consistent
- No errors in configuration
